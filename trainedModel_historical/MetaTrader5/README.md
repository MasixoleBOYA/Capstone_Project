## Overview

This folder includes:

- **`mt5_model.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook used for training machine learning models based on data from MetaTrader 5.

- **`.h5`**: A saved version of the trained model in HDF5 format. This model can be loaded and used for making predictions or further training.

- **`.keras`**: A saved version of the trained model in Keras format. This model is used within Keras/TensorFlow for inference or additional training.

- **Other `.h5` files**: These files represent additional models used for experimentation. Each file may correspond to different versions or configurations of models trained during the development process.

- **`wandb`**: This folder contains files related to Weights & Biases (Wandb) for experiment tracking, visualization, and management.
